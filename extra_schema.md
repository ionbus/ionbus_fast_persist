To both classes via their config files, I want to add the concept of extra schema. This will be a dictionary of columns to types. For every entry in this dictionary, I want the column of the appropriate type stored in the DuckDB database, and I want that same column available in the Parquet file if Parquet files are used. 

The values for these extra columns should be in data with all of the other fields. If they are not there, then the value should be null.
